## Speaker Sander Rodenhuis

- Name: Sander Rodenhuis
- Affiliation: Managing Director at Red Kubes
- Bio: Sander is a cloud solutions architect / cloud native engineer with over 20 yearsÂ of experience in IT (ops & dev). After working with Kubernetes for some time he met a fellow Kubernetes addict and together they started Red Kubes with the goal to put all their knowledge and experience in a single easy deployable and configurable solution. This solution is called Otomi Stack.
- Region: Utrecht (but can also be Amsterdam / Eindhoven
- Have you spoke before at our community events?: Nope
- Able to travel: Yes, around the Randstad
- Talk 1 abstract: Otomi Stack offers an out-of-the-box enterprise container management platform (on top of upstream Kubernetes) that increases developer efficiency and focuses on results rather than creating complexity. Otomi stack is a curated stack that integrates upstream Kubernetes with proven open source components for automated cluster operations and application lifecycle management. In this talk I will go through the Kubernetes challenges and explain how Otomi Stack can help out. During a demonstration I will show how to deploy and run workloads in a cloud agnostic way (on AKS, EKS and GKE), while still taking advantage of Cloud provider services like L7 load balancers, certificates and DNS host registration.
