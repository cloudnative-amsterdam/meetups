- Talk 1 abstract: With increased market competition and the continued pressure on software engineering organizations to deliver more software features at a higher velocity with fewer defects, developers are faced with the challenge of how to meet their goals using the existing software development platforms which do not empower developer agility or flexibility otherwise slowing innovation. Developers often use non-Cloud Native tools to build their applications, and those that use Cloud Native tools are introducing a lot of complexity and configuration.

Taco will show how D2iQ Dispatch enables developers of all skill levels, and CD operators to rapidly deploy cloud-native applications, accelerate time to value and support application modernization efforts. Dispatch uses industry best practices and modern GitOps processes to iterate on build, deploy and test applications and deploy to Kubernetes clusters at a rapid pace, without requiring configuration changes. 

In a 30-minute demo Taco will deploy a full Kubernetes cluster and CI/CD pipeline, deploying a demo application in production.
